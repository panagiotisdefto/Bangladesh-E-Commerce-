Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is ready for analysis. This  involves handling missing values, normalizing data formats, and ensuring consistency across datasets . Categorizing  the peak shopping hours (morning , noon , afternoon , night ) and the origin continent of each product ( Asia , Europe , North America).
